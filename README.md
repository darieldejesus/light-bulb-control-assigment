# Evaluation project: Light Bulbs app

This is a simple web app to interacts with light bulbs. It allows you to turn on and off the light bulbs and change their brightness as well.

## Dependency

This project uses a in-memory API to simulate the list of devices. Here you can see it https://github.com/resin-io/light-api

## Features

These are the features implemented in the app to help users to control their light bulbs.

1. Show a list with the available light bulbs.
2. Sort the list of light bulbs (devices) by name.
3. Select a light bulb from the list by clicking a row.
4. Turn the selected light bulb off/on through a switch toggle button.
5. Edit the light bulb name by click the **pencil** icon at the left of the row.
6. Change the light bulb brightness through a brightness control where you can drag a button to put the desired brightness.
7. Show a notification bar if any error comes up.

## Installation

Clone the repository to a local folder:
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/darieldejesus/light-bulb-control-assigment
$ cd light-bulb-control-assigment/
```

Define required variables. This app requires a server to fetch the devices.
You can find a example **.env** file named **.env.example** with the required variable.
```sh
$ cp .env.example .env
$ echo "REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:8080/api/v1/" >> .env
```

Then, run the following commands to install the required dependencies and start the app as development mode:
```sh
$ yarn install
$ yarn start
```
Finally, you just need to go to your browser and enter **http://localhost:3000/**.

## Running the tests
 
In order to run the tests and see the test coverage, you can execute one of these commands:

Only run the tests 
```sh
$ yarn test
``` 

Run the tests and print their coverage 
```sh
$ yarn test:coverage
``` 

## Deployment

Go to the root folder and execute the following command:
```sh
$ yarn build
``` 
The build will be located in the default **build** folder.
